}
\arguments{
\item{k}{a numeric vector the number of groups}

\item{n}{a numeric vector the numer of measurements in each group}

\item{s}{a numeric vector the standard deviation of each group}

\item{x}{a numeric vector the mean of each group}
}
\value{
a list with the test statistic and p-value
}
\description{
Test for k samples (k sample populations with unequal sized) from
Feltz CJ, Miller GE (1996) An asymptotic test for the equality of coefficients
of variation from k population. Stat Med 15:647â€“658
